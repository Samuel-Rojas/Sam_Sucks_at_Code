- When setting up a react project, depending on which verison you are running 17 or 18, if you are using the 17th version of React, then you would need to include a babel element inside of your main script tag, and creating 2 script tags that are importated which contain the react development version and the react dom 
- React lets the code to be composed and helps you create sustainable code that is readible by react developers
-React is Declaritive and meaning that it does much of the work for you and not require deep knowledge of the user to input and output commands.
- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications.
- It uses a component-based architecture, where components are reusable and can manage their own state.
- React uses JSX for templating instead of regular JavaScript. JSX looks like HTML and can be mixed with JavaScript expressions.
- Data flows unidirectionally in React applications, typically using state and props to manage and pass data.
- React creates a virtual DOM in memory, which represents the DOM state more efficiently and updates the browser's DOM in a more performance-optimized way.
- For state management in larger applications, libraries like Redux or Context API are commonly used.
- React also supports hooks (from version 16.8 onwards), which allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class.
- You could use JSX in order for storing tags and elements in a varible for example
- JSX Returns a javascript object and when you combine with react it returns in composable code
- In order to render in a mix of tags in a single line you would need a div for the child/parent code
- Try to use createRoot Instead, when on version 18
- You cannot have to child elements in JSX
- Using .render over .append is stronger because .render takes the js object that .append usually returns and spits out html/css code 
- Surrounding varibales inside of your html code in react will allow for the intergration of js into the text of html
- Anything that you put in curly braces can be read as javascript code

Props:
- To use the props object instead of the hardcoded values you use --> props.method because you are trying to access the elements inside of the object 
- If you decide to destructurize the props you would need to have the varible names like constructors in java and remove the . operator in order for the props to be defined
